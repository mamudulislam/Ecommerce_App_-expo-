# ShopEasy - Your Mobile Shopping Companion

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to ShopEasy, your new favorite mobile shopping app built with React Native and Expo. I've been working on this project to create a smooth, beautiful shopping experience that just feels right in your hands.

## What is ShopEasy?

Imagine having a personal shopping assistant in your pocket. That's what I'm building with ShopEasy. It's not just another e-commerce app - it's designed to make shopping actually enjoyable. No more clunky interfaces or confusing navigation. Just clean, intuitive design that gets you what you need, fast.

## What Can You Actually Do Here?

- **Browse thousands of products** across different categories
- **Find exactly what you want** with smart search and filters
- **Save your favorite items** for later with one tap
- **See what others are buying** with real-time trending products

### 🛒 Smart Cart & Checkout
- **Add items to your cart** in seconds
- **Apply promo codes** for instant discounts

### 🎨 It Actually Looks Good

## Getting Started - Let's Run This Thing

### What You'll Need
- A phone (iOS or Android) with the Expo Go app installed
- Or a computer with an emulator (but phone is more fun)
- Node.js on your computer (version 16 or newer)

### Step by Step Setup

1. **First, get the code:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/shopeasy-mobile.git
   cd shopeasy-mobile    

2. Install what you need:

npm install
This might take a minute - perfect time to grab a coffee ☕

3. Fire it up:
npm start

See it on your phone:

Open Expo Go app

Scan the QR code that appears in your terminal

Wait for the magic to happen ✨

If You Want to Tinker
Feel free to poke around the code! Here's where things live:

src/app/ - All the main screens

src/components/ - Reusable bits and pieces

src/contexts/ - How the app remembers things

src/utils/ - Helper functions that make life easier

Why I Built This
I got tired of shopping apps that feel like they were designed in 2010. I wanted something that:

Actually feels good to use

Respects your time

Looks modern and clean

Works smoothly without lag

So I built ShopEasy. It's still growing, but it's already pretty awesome if I do say so myself.

Current Features That Actually Work
✅ User Accounts - Sign up, log in, all that good stuff
✅ Product Browsing - Browse, search, filter - the whole deal
✅ Shopping Cart - Add stuff, remove stuff, you know the drill
✅ Wishlist - Save things for when you actually have money
✅ Order Management - Track what you've bought
✅ Dark/Light Theme - Because sometimes you're shopping at 2 AM

Coming Soon (I'm Working On It!)
🛠️ Payment Integration - Actually buy stuff for real
🛠️ Push Notifications - "Your order is here!" alerts
🛠️ Product Reviews - See what others think
🛠️ Advanced Search - Find exactly what you want
🛠️ Offline Mode - Browse even without internet

Tech Stuff (For My Fellow Nerds)
This is built with:

React Native + Expo - Because they're awesome

TypeScript - To catch mistakes before they happen

Expo Router - For smooth navigation

Context API - To manage state without going crazy

Custom UI Components - Because default ones are boring
